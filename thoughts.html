        <p>Thoughts are something no human can avoid, everyone has abundance of them everyday. Some new, some old, some creative, some boring, some worth 1M$, some worth nothing.</p>
        <p>I'll try to throw everything I think here. This is because this site is not for you to see, it is for me to see later.</p>
